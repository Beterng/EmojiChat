# Configuration file for EmojiChat by RadBuilder

# EmojiChat collects metrics in order to get a better understanding of what configurations are used.
# Statistics include how many servers it's being used on and what version of Bukkit/Spigot they're using,
# how many players are using it, server information such as Java version, how many emojis are used,
# and how many servers are using each feature. This data is anonymous, and is submitted to understand what
# types of server configurations are being used to build a better plugin (i.e. MC/Java versions to continue supporting,
# features to keep/remove). Data collection has very little/no impact on server performance. I'd appreciate if you
# keep this set to FULL, but I completely understand if you want to send less data or opt out.
#
# 'FULL'  collects what 'SOME' collects, and data on what config options you're using.
# 'SOME'  collects what 'BASIC' collects, and what hooks you're using.
# 'BASIC' collects data on what Java version you're using, Bukkit/Spigot version you're using, other general server
#         information like player count, how many emojis you've used, and shortcuts you've used.
# 'OFF'   collects NO DATA, however, I would appreciate it if you send at least basic data.

# if the player is using it in chat.

# Shortcuts will replace the items in the list with the correct emoji name.
# For example, :) will be replaced with :grinning:, which then will turn it into the emoji.

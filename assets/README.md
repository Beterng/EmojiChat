## Assets Information
This folder contains each page required for emojis. When adding or editing emojis, ensure you update **BOTH** the Gimp and Photoshop files for pages you've made changes to. Then export as a PNG replacing **BOTH** the files found in the assets folder and the files found in the resourcepack folder.  
*Refer to the README in the resourcepack folder for more information on resource packs and contributing.*
